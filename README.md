# Spatio-Temporal Forecast Modeling and Fairness of Traffic Fatality: AI for Social Good
The proposed solution consists of implementing various forecasting (Facebookâ€™s Prophet) and deep learning (ConvLSTM) modeling techniques to estimate the hotspots for traffic fatality in the future. 
The analysis was taken one step further to understand the fairness of prediction in rich and poor counties of the US. This was performed to ensure that the living conditions of people based on the Social Vulnerability Index(SVI) do not affect the forecasting results. The motivation behind this research is to provide causal inference that can help design safe roads in the future.
